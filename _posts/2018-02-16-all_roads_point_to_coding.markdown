Nothing brings your life achievements into perspective quite like talking to a high school senior in the throes of college acceptance season. On a recent trip back home for the holidays, I joked to my 18 year old stepbrother that he shouldn't stress too much about making The Right Decision on his college, topic of study, or future career aspirations. After all, at the age of 28, I was already gearing up for my third career change (or maybe more...do micro-pivots count?). Would my 18 year old self be surprised at my latest venture into coding and web development? Absolutely shocked? No...more like exasperated, yet ambivalent. My childlike wonder brain is a sucker for shiny new things.

As I look back the ten years of adulthood life experience I've lived so far, it's really no wonder I've chosen to code. The cumulative effect of all my failures, pitfalls, and life overhauls have narrowed down my focus in my career and its overlap into my personal life. Software engineering is the roses amidst the thorns---while some only see its challenges, I see opportunity and community. 

Coding affords me a safe place to learn new things, constantly, and alongside others who share my dedication in continuously adding and improving current and up-and-coming systems. That room to play creatively with what is and what could be can keep me occupied in a waiting room or on a long cross country drive for hours on end. Not too many industries reward that particular behavior, nevermind pay teams of people to inhabit just such a space. What I needed next was a bridge to get to that magical place.

After dabbling in a variety of industries over the years, from retail to education to finance, my desire for cooperation and team cohesion always seemed to dovetail with the competitive nature of captialism. The "numbers" do better when there's a competition between people/teams/departments...right? For me, the motivation to do well, to exceed expectations dies as soon as I am taken out of a collaborative environment. My awareness of this behavior has only grown stronger over the years. I can get by with my desire to effectively problem solve, to work alongside a client to sort through their options to find the best fit for them. My only indicator of success is if the need is met---not if someone signed on the dotted line.

So what is a creative problem solver with a penchant for teamwork supposed to do? Translate it to an industry that respects and rewards those values. I think I have an idea where to start.
